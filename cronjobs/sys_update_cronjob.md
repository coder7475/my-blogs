# Automating System Updates with Cron Jobs

Keeping your server up to date is crucial for security and performance. One effective way to automate this process is by using cron jobs. In this post, we will walk you through setting up a cron job that performs system updates daily at 1:00 AM.

## What is a Cron Job?

A cron job is a scheduled task in Unix-like operating systems that allows you to run scripts or commands at specified intervals. This is particularly useful for routine maintenance tasks, such as system updates.

## Setting Up a System Update Cron Job
### Assumption

**OS**: Ubuntu
**linux username**: admin

### Step 1: Create the Cron Job
Open the crontab with:
```bash
crontab -e
```
To set up a system update cron job, you need to add the following line to your crontab:
```bash
0 1 * * * sudo /home/admin/scripts/system_update.sh >> /var/log/system_update.log 2>&1
```

This cron job runs daily at 1:00 AM and performs the following tasks:

- Updates package lists (`apt update`)
- Upgrades installed packages (`apt upgrade`)
- Removes unnecessary packages (`apt autoremove`)
- Logs all output to `/var/log/system_update.log`

### Step 2: Create the System Update Script

Before the cron job can run, you need to create a script that performs the update tasks. Follow these steps:

1. **Create a directory for your scripts**:

   ```bash
   mkdir ~/scripts
   ```

2. **Create the system update script**:

   ```bash
   touch ~/scripts/system_update.sh
   chmod +x ~/scripts/system_update.sh
   ```

3. **Open the script and add the following code**:

   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   # Script to update, upgrade, and autoremove packages

   # Function to check if a command was successful
   check_status() {
       if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
           echo "Error: $1 failed"
           exit 1
       fi
   }

   echo "Starting system update and upgrade..."

   # Run apt update
   sudo apt update
   check_status "apt update"

   # Run apt upgrade with automatic yes to prompts
   sudo apt upgrade -y
   check_status "apt upgrade"

   # Run apt autoremove to remove unnecessary packages
   sudo apt autoremove -y
   check_status "apt autoremove"

   echo "System update, upgrade, and autoremove completed successfully."
   ```

### Step 3: Create the Log File

To ensure that your script can log its output, create the log file with the appropriate permissions:

```bash
sudo touch /var/log/system_update.log
sudo chown admin:admin /var/log/system_update.log
```

change the `admin` with your actual username of linux system.

### Step 4: Configure Sudo Privileges

For the cron job to run without prompting for a password, you need to configure sudo privileges. Open the sudoers file using `visudo` and add the following line:

```
admin ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/apt update, /usr/bin/apt upgrade -y, /usr/bin/apt autoremove -y
```

**Note**: Replace `admin` with your actual username if it differs.

## Conclusion

By following these steps, you can automate your system updates, ensuring that your server remains secure and up to date without manual intervention. Regular updates are essential for maintaining the health of your system, and using cron jobs is a simple yet effective way to achieve this.

Happy scripting!
