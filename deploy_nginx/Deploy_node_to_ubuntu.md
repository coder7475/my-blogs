## How to Deploy to Ubuntu Server

This is documentation about how you can deploy a node app to a server with nginx whether it is a `vps`, `vds`, `dedicated server`, `aws ec2` instance etc. This assumes your familiar with basic linux commands.

### Assumptions

1. A hosting with full root access and a domain
2. **OS**: Ubuntu 22.04
3. **IP**: 172.172.172.172
4. **Domain Name**: example.com
5. Using a Linux terminal on your local computer

### Workflow Steps

---

#### 1. Secure Your Server

##### A. Login to your server

1. Open your terminal (bash, zsh etc)

```
ssh root@172.172.172.172
```

you will be prompted to give root password. After giving you will be logged into your server. See something like this:

```bash
root@vm172048:~$
```

If so you have Successfully logged in as root user.

##### B. First Server Hardening

Now we are inside our machine and we can start installing the necessary packages and software but before that letâ€™s upgrade our system. Enter below command in your terminal:

```bash
apt update && apt upgrade -y
```

Now, all the current packages are installed to latest patch version which keeps the system safe from "unpatched vulnerability exploitation"
